#TODO:The quadratic equation is given with the following formula: pow(x,2)+5*x+4=0
# Using Vieta's formulas calculate the sum and product of the roots of this quadratic equation. Print the result to the console as shown below.

print(f"x1 + x2 = {-5/1}")
print(f"x1x2 = {4/1}")

a = 1
b = 5
c = 4
sum = -b / a
product = c / a
print(f'x1 + x2 = {sum}\nx1x2 = {product}')
